[sLaNGjIs team do not providing support on wordpress.org forum and reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-missed-schedule/other_notes/) because we are not interested in reviews o stars on our plugins!

Dear user of plugins or themes: Missed Schedule is a WordPress Bug!

sLaNGjIs Team has started official adventure on WordPress.org forum since 2007!

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the WordPress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable requests and those definable trash are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

The problems of this type of assistance, through that instruments, have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of support.

Our team has tried to respond to all for more long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean.

Due to this big limitation of platform, and the result of failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, as of today August 15 2014, we abandon the active support of this type of structure, started since July 7 2007, to try to give one type of personalized service, targeted to the requests of real user utilization and totally Free of Charge:

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Possibility that some of us then reply or write on it, will be very low!
